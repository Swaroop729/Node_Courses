/*Nodemon : 
While using the node we need to go back each time run the node command for the file in the terminal 
instead of that we can add a cmd terminal utility as Nodemon and we can use it.
To install nodemon 
Npm install nodemon â€“g 

While using generally we use the scripts running with node then node watcher is not enabled

but while using the nodemon the watcher is enabled and once you change the sourcefile and save it
it instantly runs and shows the output

Usage using node : node filename.js
Usage using nodemon : nodemon filename.js
